# Security Analysis regarding CVE

This repository contains a interactive programming example for scanning your software and analysing it regarding common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) with jQAssistant, Neo4j, Jupyter Notebook, Python and co.

This example uses the open source sample project "Spring PetClinic" that was only modified by adding jQAssistant. You can change the used dump yourself by editing the postBuild file within "binder". 

## How to Use

To launch the Jupyter Notebook just click on this badge [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/softvis-research/security-analysis/main).

A new tab will then be opened where you can see the environment including Jupyter and Neo4j getting spinned up.
There is no further integration or download needed in this example.
